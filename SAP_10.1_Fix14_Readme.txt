This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the 
release.

WSP-2274
IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP introduces a new public service
pub.sap.transaction:copyTransactionsToDB. The service copies the current
transactions in the file transaction store into the MySQL database transaction
store. For more information about the input parameters and return values, see
IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP Installation and User's Guide.

Note: Ensure that all RFC listeners and RFC connections are disabled and
that no transactional processing occurs when the service is run, otherwise
the copied transactions may be in an invalid state.

WSP-2220
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, a new public service
pub.sap.transaction:storeSize is introduced. The service returns the current
size of the transaction store, which is the number of transaction entries in the
store. The service provides the user with an efficient way to monitor the size
of the store regularly to prevent it from growing out of bounds.

WSP-2210
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, executing the pub.sap.transaction:sweep
service could cause excessive CPU utilization when executed on a very large
transaction store.

This issue is now resolved.

Set the watt.sap.xtn.fileStore.threads property in Integration Server
Administrator > Extended > Settings page. The property defines the number of CPU
threads used in the pub.sap.transaction:sweep service. The property must be set
to a positive value between 1 and 6. Default value is 4. 

WSP-2040
IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP now allows the use of an external MySQL database
to host the transaction store as an alternative to the file system.

Enabling the MySQL transaction store requires the installation of the webMethods
Adapter for SAP Database Scripts 10.1 and setting watt.sap.xtn.useSQL to true in
Integration Server Administrator > Settings > Extended. For more information
about Transaction Store on MySQL, see IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP Installation
and User's Guide.

WSP-2039
IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP introduces a new public service
pub.sap.transaction:createFunctionalPoolDriverAlias. The service creates a
Integration Server JDBC driver alias, pool alias, and functional alias for IBM
webMethods Adapter for SAP in addition to setting the watt.sap.xtn.useSQL
configuration parameter to true, which is a pre-requisite to use MySQL for
transaction store. For more information about the service's input and return
values, see IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP Installation and User's Guide.

WSP-2034
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the start-up log message displaying the current 
version and build number of the adapter uses the wrong log facility 114 instead
of 101.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1961
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the transaction file store may cause high CPU load
on Integration Server 10.11 and higher.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-2222 (SAP_10.1_Fix13)
Updated copyright notes, vendor, and product names for IBM rebranding.

WSP-2157 (SAP_10.1_Fix13)
In webMethods Adapter for SAP, the 'Function Search' lookup in the UI fails with 
InvocationTargetException if webMethods SAP Adapter 10.1 Fix 12 is installed.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-2041 (SAP_10.1_Fix12)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, a new public service
pub.sap.util:getListenerRuntimeStatus is introduced, which returns the current
accurate runtime status of an RFC Listener instance. The service can be used to
monitor and report the RFC Listener status and also for automated health checks to
determine the current state, thread usage, and latency of an RFC listener.

WSP-2029 (SAP_10.1_Fix12)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the adapter may partially load after exiting
Integration Server Quiesce mode.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-2004 (SAP_10.1_Fix12)

when an empty string is passed for the eventName input parameter.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1999 (SAP_10.1_Fix12)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the search for all available Business Objects in 
the SAP system returns an empty list if the DDIC cache is cleared before the 
search.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-1970 (SAP_10.1_Fix12)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, two or more RFC Listener instances with identical
configurations cannot be enabled at the same time. The underlying SAP JCo library
imposes the limitation. The resulting error message now contains the names of
the identical RFC listener instances for easier identification and resolution of
the issue.

WSP-1931 (SAP_10.1_Fix12)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the metadata of the connected SAP systems is stored
in an internal cache to accelerate SAP document processing. If the metadata is
changed in the SAP system, then the changes are not automatically updated in the
internal cache. A manual reset of the cache is required to avoid errors in the
SAP payload data.

This issue is now resolved.

In Integration Server Administrator > Extended > Settings page, set the
watt.sap.repo.check.interval to a positive value larger than 0. The value set in
the property is the time interval (in minutes) to check the internal SAP metadata
caches for outdated entries and to remove them if exist. If the property value
is set to 0 or a negative value results in default behavior, where the internal
SAP metadata caches are not checked for outdated entries. 

WSP-1874 (SAP_10.1_Fix12)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, an internal decoding error causes the logging of
the "The LockInfo object is invalid" error messages in the Integration Server logs.
 
This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1881 (SAP_10.1_Fix11)
In Integration Server Administrator > IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP > Monitoring
screen, a NullPointerException appears when two similar RFC listener instances
with identical Program ID are enabled.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1866 (SAP_10.1_Fix11)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the RFC adapter service calls execute redundant
user access right checks ignoring the value set in watt.sap.strictDefaultUserCheck
property if webMethods SAP Adapter 10.1 Fix 10 is installed.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1861 (SAP_10.1_Fix11)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, a new public service pub.sap.util:createTID is
introduced. The service can be used to create an SAP Transaction ID without
requiring an SAP connection, providing more flexibility and performance than the
pub.sap.client:createTID service. The Transaction ID is based on randomly created
UUID Version 4.

Set the watt.sap.fastTIDCreation property to true in Integration Server
Administrator > Settings > Extended to ensure that the IBM webMethods Adapter for
SAP uses the fast, offline method of creating Transaction ID in the existing
public service pub.sap.client:createTID. 

WSP-1858 (SAP_10.1_Fix11)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, when executing the Publish And Wait operation of
a synchronous ALE notification, a "Field is absent, field must exist" error
appears for the "_env" field. The "_env" field is not populated in the IDoc
received by the listener, whereas the field is set as mandatory in the
publishable RequestDocument generated by the ALE notification.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1826 (SAP_10.1_Fix11)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, RFC connections to SAP systems of release 4.6 
(or below) cannot be enabled anymore if Fix10 has been installed.

This issue is resolved now. 

WSP-1820 (SAP_10.1_Fix11)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, you cannot enable or disable a suspended
connection if Integration Server is hosted on a Linux operating system.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1745 (SAP_10.1_Fix10)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, if X.509 client authentication is used in a
session, then the SNC connections with user/password authentication fail.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1708 (SAP_10.1_Fix10)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, when Integration Server session is terminated, the
transactions may fail with the exception "connection closed after cancel".

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1545 (SAP_10.1_Fix10)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the RFC adapter services contain the fields
$runtime and $rfctime that are defined as java.lang.Long type in the output
signature. However, the values returned in these fields are of type
java.lang.String when the service is executed.

This issue is now resolved.

The fields $runtime and $rfctime are defined as java.lang.String type in the
output signature of the RFC adapter service. 

WSP-1508 (SAP_10.1_Fix10)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the Routing Mapping and SAP Users which can be
configured from Integration Server Administrator are available as configuration
variables template generated by Microservices Runtime.

You can now update the values of the properties in the application.properties
file and pass to a Microservices Runtime.
Ensure that the Integration Server core fixes and ART fix are also installed.
This feature is available in webMethods Integration Server 10.7 or higher.

WSP-1359 (SAP_10.1_Fix10)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the connection appears disabled in the Integration
Server Administrator interface when enabling connection fails during Integration
Server startup.

This issue is now resolved.

A new connection state Suspended is introduced for the connections. When enabling
connection fails during Integration Server startup, the connection state is
Suspended. This feature is available in Integration Server 10.7 and later. 

WSP-1522 (SAP_10.1_Fix9)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the RFC listeners are sometimes not enabled during
adapter startup and remain in the Failed status, in Integration Server 10.7 and
higher, if the SAP JCo library version 3.1.4 or 3.1.5 is installed.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1518 (SAP_10.1_Fix9)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the endDate and startDate input parameters of 
the pub.sap.transaction:list public service are ignored, if the values are not
provided in the "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS z" format with decimal point and
decimal places.

This issue is now resolved.

The decimal point and decimal places are bypassed for the endDate and startDate
input parameters of the pub.sap.transaction:list service.

WSP-1505 (SAP_10.1_Fix9)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the automatic sharing of a single repository
connection between RFC connections to the same SAP system may result in metadata
access exceptions, if the default user of one of the RFC connections does not have
the required metadata access rights in SAP.

This issue is now resolved.

If the property watt.sap.strictDefaultUserCheck is set to true, the adapter checks
the metadata access rights of the default user before an RFC connection is enabled.
The RFC connection cannot be enabled if the default user does not have the required
access rights.

Alternatively, you can set a dedicated repository user for an RFC connection using
the 'Repository User Name' and 'Repository Password' properties. All RFC and IDoc
metadata access calls are then executed with the repository user. All other
non-metadata RFC calls are executed with the default user.

WSP-1503 (SAP_10.1_Fix9)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the CSRF token must not be visible in the hyperlink
when you enable the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) guard in Integration Server.

In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the user is unable to enable the connection if
the property watt.art.connection.byPassConnValidation is set to true and SAP
system is unavailable during Integration Server startup.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-1433 (SAP_10.1_Fix6)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the user exit service, sample.sap.idoc.Mappings:ordrsp
throws a NullPointerException for inbound IDocs of message type ORDRSP.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1415 (SAP_10.1_Fix6)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the user token $MYSAPSSO2$ cannot be set as the
default user for an RFC client connection.

This issue is now resolved.

The user token $MYSAPSSO2$ can be set as the default user.
The password for this default user is a base64-encoded SSO logon ticket. 

WSP-1412 (SAP_10.1_Fix6)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, internal references to closed Integration Server 
sessions are not always deleted and may cause memory exhaustion.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-1364 (SAP_10.1_Fix6)

a connection. This feature is only available on Integration Server 10.7 and higher. 

WSP-1396 (SAP_10.1_Fix5)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the throughput performance logging does not work
with SAP JCo version 3.1.3 and later.
 
If you install SAP JCo middleware version 3.1.3 and if watt.sap.throughput is
set to true, then webMethods SAP Adapter 10.1 displays the error message
"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError".
 
This issue is now resolved. The adapter now supports throughput logging with
SAP JCo version 3.1.3 and later. 

WSP-1327 (SAP_10.1_Fix5)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, 2 metadata entries, build and subsystem are
required in manifest.v3 file of WmSAP package for the SPM Plugin to work
correctly. These metadata entries are not getting added if WmSAP package is
loaded partially.

This issue is now resolved.

WSP-1323 (SAP_10.1_Fix5)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, autocomplete property for the password fields is
enabled in the Integration Server Administrator page of the adapter.
 
The password fields with autocomplete property enabled is a security
vulnerability.
 
The issue is now resolved.

WSP-1320 (SAP_10.1_Fix5)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the warning "Second directory could not be created"
appears in the server logs for a few transactions under high transaction traffic.
The message appears because the path of the second directory is not correct in
the logging logic of the transaction store.

This issue is resolved.

WSP-1297 (SAP_10.1_Fix4)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, Cloud Container environment is unable to load the

RFC Listeners at several SAP Gateway instances to achieve high availability and
to improve load balancing. The webMethods SAP Adapter 10.1 needs to be enhanced
to use this new JCo feature for RFC Listeners.

This issue is now resolved. The adapter now supports the automatic registration
of an RFC Listener at multiple SAP Gateway instances.

WSP-1281 (SAP_10.1_Fix4)
webMethods SAP Adapter 10.1 is not compatible with SAP JCo version
3.1.2 and later.

When you install SAP JCo middleware version 3.1.2 or later, then
webMethods SAP Adapter 10.1 fails to load with the following error message:
Error registering SAP Adapter with ART: WmSAP 10.1 requires SAP
JCo 3.0.18 (or higher) and is not compatible with earlier JCo
versions 2.x or 3.0.0 to 3.0.17.

This issue is resolved. The adapter is now compatible with SAP
JCo version 3.1.2 and later. 

WSP-1278 (SAP_10.1_Fix4)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the pub.sap.monitor.systat01:report service can
throw NullPointerExceptions when the connection attribute 'Log transaction status'
is set to the Off state for at least a single RFC Listener which is receiving
IDocs.

This issue is now resolved. The connection attribute 'Log transaction status'
is automatically enabled if an RFC Listener receives the IDocs.

WSP-1250 (SAP_10.1_Fix3)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the ALE notifications fail with Java type
mismatch exception after installing Fix1.

During runtime, the Java type and the ordering of IDoc segment field values are
different compared to the IDoc document specification. This causes Java type
mismatch exceptions.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-1232 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the enhanced SAP IDocLib 3.0.13 API is not
used to send the heterogenous IDoc lists.

This issue is resolved. The adapter now includes the pub.sap.client:sendIDocLists
service which allows sending multiple IDoc lists of different IDoc types in a
single tRFC transaction. 

WSP-1226 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the enhanced SAP IDocLib 3.0.13 API is not used
to improve the performance of IDoc inbound processing.

This issue is resolved. The adapter now uses SAP IDocLib 3.0.13 API to
increase the performance of the 
pub.sap.idoc:iDocToDocument and pub.sap.idoc:iDocToTables methods for large IDocs. 

WSP-1222 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the Return to Results link fails to retrieve the
results of the previous RFC function call with an exception.

This issue occurs when you execute an RFC function test in the adapter's Lookup
page and then click the Return to Results link in the table view to return to 
the results of the RFC function call.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-1218 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, Repository Server in the Listener page contains
duplicate options.

If two or more connections have the same connection alias, the Repository Server
contains duplicate options in the Listener page.

This issue is now resolved. 

WSP-1210 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the inbound request from SAP cannot be processed,
if the requests are sent using the bgRFC protocol.

This issue is resolved. Now, the adapter can process the inbound SAP requests
using the bgRFC protocol. 

WSP-1197 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the documentation is missing for Java IDoc API.

This issue is resolved. IDoc Java API documentation is now included in
Adapter for SAP. 

WSP-1196 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the processing of inbound IDocs and the execution
of the pub.sap.idoc:iDocToDocument service fails with the following exception-
com.wm.data.IData; cannot be cast to java.util.ArrayList

This issue is now resolved.  

WSP-1191 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, if the CIM type field is not set, then you must
create additional ALE notifications to process IDocs with CIM type extensions.

This issue is resolved. Now, setting an empty CIM type notification field to the
wildcard character (*) restores the runtime behavior of the adapter and allows
to process all IDocs with or without CIM type extension.

WSP-1165 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, if the default user of a master repository
connection does not have the necessary access rights in SAP, then specific
error log messages are not generated.

This issue can occur for the below situations:
- after a new RFC connection is created
- if there is a change in the startup order of RFC connections

The cause for this issue is when the default user of the connection does not have
necessary access rights in SAP and the connection becomes the master repository
connection for the other connections to the same SAP system.

This issue is resolved. Now, the adapter logs display a more descriptive error
message, if the default user does not have the necessary access rights in SAP. 

RGHADPESTBL-4599 (SAP_10.1_Fix1)
In IBM webMethods Adapter for SAP, the home page is updated with minimal 
compliance with DELITE.
